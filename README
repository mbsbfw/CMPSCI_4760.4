>Process Scheduling

>This program will simulate a process scheduling part of an operating system. 
Message queues will be used for sychronization.

>This Project is not finished. I have set up my shared memory and some of my 
message queue functions and was starting on scheduling the processes and 
thats when it really got tough.

>This is one the hardest projects I have yet to work on and it was and is a 
learning experience.
